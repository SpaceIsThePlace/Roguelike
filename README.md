h2. Introduction

This is my personal entry for /r/roguelike dev Roguelike tutorial
I will start by making a very simple roguelike (movement, randomly generated dungeon, permadeath, monster with limited IA), and then plan to expand it once the basics are done.
The idea is to develop a full roguelike with some light tower-defense mechanics (not sure how they're going to work yet in a turn-based game).
The roguelike will be fully developed using Godot + GDScript. Tiles are from here: https://www.kenney.nl/assets/bit-pack.


h2. Mechanics
* Turn-based (everything moves after the player makes his/her movement)
* Randomly generated dungeon
* Permadeath
* Different classes
* Light tower-defense mechanics:
** Enemies keeps spawning for n number of rounds 
** The player has to defend a static item (probably a tree) for n + x turns
** The player can set up traps, turrets, and spawn creatures (might be class-based)
** After n + x turns, the item no longer needs protecting, and the player can access a portal to go to a new stage

h2. Setting
I'm a sucker for stories set in dying Earth scenarios, so that's probably what I will use. 
The player will have to defend trees (maybe, I like the ecological theme as well) from spawns of creatures of unclear origins.
